# Exercise 3

This java producer will create a topic called `ipt-spesen` and produce data every 5 seconds.

It should simulate the "expenses-flow" within ipt. For this it will randomly choose a employee, description of the expense and a random value between 0-1000 CHF.

The produced data of this topic will be used in the future examples using Kafka Streams and Kafka Connect.

1. **Open up IntelliJ**

1. **Check the code and try to understand what is been coded**

1. **Build the code and press run**

1. **Use either the Kafka UI or the consumer console to see that data has been produced**

1. **... be happy that you've just created the first Java Kafka Producer :-)**
